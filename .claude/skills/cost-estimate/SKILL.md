# Cost Estimation Skill

You are producing a hosting and infrastructure cost estimate for an application. The output is a decision-grade table the user can bring to a budget conversation, plus concrete levers to pull if the number is too high.

Never guess at prices. Pricing changes frequently — always fetch current published pricing before producing the final table. Stale pricing is worse than no estimate.

## Phase 1: Inspect the project

Understand what is actually deployed (or planned to deploy) before asking the user anything. Read the code, not the README.

### What to identify

1. **Hosting provider(s)** — look for:
   - `app.yaml` (DigitalOcean App Platform)
   - `vercel.json` / `.vercel/` (Vercel)

   When detecting a `databases:` block in `app.yaml`, differentiate the deployment shape — the presence and shape of `databases:` is the biggest DO cost signal:
   - **Low estimate**: the app creates new clusters per env (~$15 PG + $15 Valkey per env = $30 base for a one-off project)
   - **Mid estimate**: prod + staging share clusters via dedicated PG users + `db_name`/`db_user` binding (saves ~$15/mo on staging) — recognized by `app.staging.yaml` referencing the same `cluster_name` as prod with different `db_name`/`db_user`
   - **High estimate**: HA standby on PG + Valkey (~$60+ baseline for production-grade)

   - `netlify.toml` (Netlify)
   - `fly.toml` (Fly.io)
   - `render.yaml` (Render)
   - `railway.toml` / `.railway/` (Railway)
   - `serverless.yml` / `sam.yaml` / CDK / Terraform (AWS)
   - `cloudbuild.yaml` / `app.yaml` at root with `runtime:` key (GCP App Engine)
   - `azure-pipelines.yml` + Bicep/ARM (Azure)
   - `Dockerfile` + Kubernetes manifests (self-managed K8s)
   - `docker-compose.yml` as the only deploy artifact (self-hosted / VPS)

2. **Managed services referenced in config or env**:
   - Databases: Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, Firestore, PlanetScale, Neon, Supabase, Railway PG
   - Caches/queues: Redis, Valkey, Upstash, Memcached, SQS, PubSub
   - Object storage: S3, R2, GCS, Azure Blob, Spaces
   - Email: Resend, SendGrid, Postmark, SES, Mailgun
   - Error tracking: Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag, Datadog
   - Analytics: PostHog, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Segment
   - AI providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google (Gemini), Groq, Together, Replicate
   - Auth SaaS: Clerk, Auth0, WorkOS, Stytch (vs. self-hosted like Better Auth)
   - Payments: Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy
   - CDN / edge: Cloudflare, Fastly

3. **Workload shape** — read the code to understand what actually runs:
   - HTTP request handlers (web tier sizing)
   - Background workers / queue consumers (worker tier sizing)
   - Cron / scheduled jobs
   - WebSockets / SSE / long-lived connections (changes autoscaling math)
   - Heavy AI calls or streaming (latency / memory implications)
   - Large file handling (memory / bandwidth implications)

4. **Environment model** — check for:
   - Branch-based preview envs
   - Explicit staging/UAT configs
   - Any references to multiple envs in CI/CD workflows

### Output of Phase 1

A short internal inventory you can reference. Do not dump this to the user yet — you'll surface the relevant pieces in Phase 3.

If the project has **no identifiable hosting config** (greenfield), ask the user which provider they're targeting before continuing. If multiple providers are in play, estimate each separately and sum.

## Phase 2: Gather sizing inputs

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to collect sizing data. Ask only what you need — skip questions the code already answers (e.g. don't ask if they need a worker if `app.yaml` already declares one).

Ask these in a **single AskUserQuestion call** so the user sees them together. Provide sensible multiple-choice options plus a free-form fallback.

### Required questions

1. **Total user base size** — how many registered/known users total
   - Options: `<50`, `50–500`, `500–5k`, `5k–50k`, `50k+`, free text

2. **Peak concurrent users** — how many simultaneously active during a normal peak
   - Options: `<10`, `10–50`, `50–250`, `250–1000`, `1000+`, free text
   - If the user doesn't know, use a rule of thumb: ~1–5% of daily actives, ~0.1–1% of total users depending on app type

3. **User type** — affects sizing cushion needed
   - Options: `Internal tool (trusted users, predictable load)`, `B2B SaaS (business hours traffic)`, `Consumer (spiky, unpredictable)`, `Public / viral potential`

4. **Environments needed**
   - Options: `Prod only`, `Prod + staging`, `Prod + staging + UAT`, `Prod + preview envs per PR`

5. **Data volume expectations after 12 months** — drives DB + storage sizing
   - Options: `<1 GB`, `1–10 GB`, `10–100 GB`, `100 GB–1 TB`, `1 TB+`, free text

6. **Background job volume** — only if a worker is present
   - Options: `Rare (<100/day)`, `Light (100–10k/day)`, `Heavy (10k–1M/day)`, `Very heavy (1M+/day)`

7. **AI usage** — only if AI SDKs are detected
   - Options: `None`, `Occasional (<1k calls/mo)`, `Regular (1k–100k/mo)`, `Heavy (100k+/mo)`, free text
   - Note: AI API costs are usually separate from hosting and often dominate; flag this explicitly.

8. **Uptime / availability needs**
   - Options: `Best-effort (brief downtime OK)`, `Business-critical (HA required)`, `99.9%+ SLA`

### Optional questions (ask only if relevant)

- Regional requirements (single region vs. multi-region)
- Compliance constraints (HIPAA, SOC2, data residency) — these force premium tiers
- Existing commitments/credits (AWS Activate, GCP credits, DO credits) — affects effective price

## Phase 3: Fetch current pricing

Use WebSearch or WebFetch to pull **current pricing from the provider's own pricing page** for every paid component identified. Do not rely on memory — pricing shifts quarterly.

### What to fetch

For each identified provider, get:
- Compute tiers and their specs (vCPU, RAM, $/mo)
- Managed database tiers (including HA / standby pricing)
- Managed cache/queue tiers
- Bandwidth / egress pricing (often a hidden cost)
- Object storage ($/GB stored + $/GB transferred + per-request fees)
- Any platform fees (e.g. DO App Platform static site tier, Vercel seat pricing)

For third-party SaaS (Resend, Sentry, Stripe, etc.):
- Free tier limits
- Next-tier pricing
- Per-unit pricing (per email, per event, per transaction)

Cite the source URL inline in the final table footer so the user can verify.

### Pricing cache

If multiple cost estimates are done in the same session for the same provider, cache the numbers in conversation context — don't re-fetch. But always re-fetch across sessions.

## Phase 4: Produce the estimate

Build a **single comparison table** with three columns: **Low**, **Mid**, **High**.

### Sizing philosophy

- **Low** — smallest viable configuration. Assumes best-effort uptime, shared managed services where safe, minimum instance sizes. Target: pre-launch, internal tools, or "prove it works" stage.
- **Mid** — recommended launch configuration. Prod has appropriate headroom; staging is real but downsized; managed services sized for 12-month data growth; no HA unless required.
- **High** — sized for the peak concurrency the user gave you, with HA on critical tiers. This is the "we hit our numbers" configuration.

### Table structure

```markdown
| Component | Low | Mid | High |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PRODUCTION** | | | |
| Web / app tier | [size] — $X | [size] — $X | [size] × N (HA) — $X |
| Worker tier | [size] — $X | [size] — $X | [size] × N — $X |
| Scheduled jobs | per-run — ~$X | per-run — ~$X | per-run — ~$X |
| Database (managed) | [tier] — $X | [tier] — $X | [tier] + standby — $X |
| Cache / queue | [tier] — $X | [tier] — $X | [tier] — $X |
| Object storage | $X | $X | $X |
| Bandwidth / egress | included | ~$X | ~$X |
| **STAGING / UAT** (if requested) | | | |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **THIRD-PARTY SAAS** | | | |
| Email (Resend/etc.) | free tier — $0 | $X | $X |
| Error tracking | free tier — $0 | $X | $X |
| AI API (variable) | ~$X | ~$X | ~$X |
| **TOTAL** | **~$X/mo** | **~$X/mo** | **~$X/mo** |
```

### Rationale section

Below the table, include a short section per tier explaining **why** that sizing was chosen. Call out:
- What drove the size decision (user count? concurrency? data volume?)
- What would force an upgrade to the next tier
- What scales linearly vs. what scales in jumps (managed DB tiers are often 2× jumps; compute is more granular)

### Hidden / variable costs

Always end with a "not in the table" section covering:
- AI API token costs (can dwarf hosting at scale — show estimate based on volume given)
- Payment processor fees (Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30; not a fixed line but large at volume)
- Domain registration (~$12/year)
- Third-party integrations not yet chosen
- Data egress beyond free tier (especially AWS — can be a nasty surprise)
- Backup storage if not included
- DDoS / WAF protection at scale

## Phase 5: Cost-saving architectural compromises

This is the most valuable part of the output. Propose concrete changes that reduce cost **without** hurting the user experience or removing features.

### Good compromises (suggest these)

- **Shared managed services across non-prod envs.** One PG cluster with multiple logical DBs, one Redis with multiple DB indexes. Safe if staging/UAT load is minimal. Saves $15–30/mo per extra env on most providers.
- **Preview envs instead of permanent staging.** Branch-based ephemeral envs cost only during PR lifetime. Works well for internal tools.
- **Downsized non-prod compute.** Staging doesn't need prod-sized instances to validate functionality. Halve or quarter the tier.
- **Deferred HA until measurable traffic.** Launch on single-node managed DB; upgrade to standby once there are real users to protect.
- **Object storage instead of DB for large blobs.** Storing files/attachments in DB inflates backup size and premium tier requirements. Move to S3/R2/Spaces.
- **Cloudflare R2 instead of S3** for frequently-read storage (no egress fees). Saves massively if bandwidth is a factor.
- **Single region unless needed.** Multi-region doubles infra cost and adds complexity. Only needed for latency-sensitive global apps or compliance.
- **Autoscaling min=1.** Pay for one instance baseline, scale up on load rather than provisioning for peak 24/7.
- **Cached read replicas for analytics.** Move heavy read queries off the primary so you don't need to oversize the primary.
- **Use platform free tiers fully.** Sentry, Resend, PostHog, Cloudflare all have meaningful free tiers for small apps.
- **Spot / preemptible instances for workers.** If jobs are retryable (they should be with BullMQ), workers can run on spot instances at 60–80% discount.

### Bad compromises (do NOT suggest)

Never propose compromises that hurt users or violate the project's conventions:
- ❌ Skipping backups to save on DB tier
- ❌ Disabling HA on prod once you have real users
- ❌ Eliminating the worker tier and running jobs inline in request handlers
- ❌ Shared prod DB between unrelated apps (security + blast radius)
- ❌ Undersizing RAM to the point of OOM restarts
- ❌ Dropping error tracking or observability to save $26/mo
- ❌ Moving to a cheaper but unvetted provider for core services

### Format the compromises as a menu

Present each compromise as:

```markdown
**[Compromise name]** — saves ~$X/mo
**What changes:** [concrete config delta]
**Impact on users:** None / Minimal / [specific impact if any]
**When to reconsider:** [condition that should trigger undoing this]
```

This lets the user pick from the menu rather than accepting a single opinionated plan.

## Phase 6: Summary and recommendation

End with:
1. A one-line headline: "Realistic launch cost: **~$X/mo**, growing to **~$Y/mo** at [specified concurrency]."
2. Which of the three tiers you'd actually recommend the user start with, given their answers.
3. The top 2–3 cost-saving compromises from Phase 5 that fit their context.
4. The cost drivers to watch — which line item grows fastest with scale and when to re-evaluate.

## Important guidelines

- **Always fetch live pricing.** Memory-based numbers are outdated. Use WebSearch/WebFetch and cite URLs.
- **Be honest about ranges.** "$X–$Y" is more useful than a false-precision single number. Compute can be exact; bandwidth and AI are ranges.
- **Separate fixed from variable costs.** Fixed (compute, DB tier) vs. variable (bandwidth, AI tokens, emails sent). Users budget differently for each.
- **Call out the dominant cost.** At small scale it's usually DB floor prices. At mid-scale it's compute. At large scale it's often AI API calls or bandwidth. Name the dominant cost explicitly so the user knows where to focus optimization.
- **Don't over-engineer the estimate.** A reasonable ±20% estimate delivered quickly beats a perfect estimate delivered late. Users want decision-grade numbers, not accounting-grade.
- **Respect existing architecture decisions.** Do not propose wholesale stack changes in the compromises section. Work within the chosen stack. Stack migration is a separate conversation (see the `migrate` skill).
- **Flag AI API costs prominently.** For AI-heavy apps, token costs can be 5–10× the hosting bill. Users are often surprised. Show a rough estimate based on expected call volume and typical token counts.
- **Show the math on concurrency sizing.** If the user says "250 concurrent," explain why that maps to N instances of tier M. The reasoning is as valuable as the number.
- **Update, don't restart.** If the user asks to adjust a parameter (e.g. "flip low and mid", "add staging", "what if we went to 500 concurrent"), keep the existing structure and adjust — don't rebuild the table from scratch.
